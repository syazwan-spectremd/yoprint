Hi, Basically this is the least that I can do for the test you've given to me last week.
Unfortunately i am not able to implement Laravel Horizon since there is an compatibality issue with Windows Machine. After many research has been done, turns out PCNTL extension is not supported in windows. 
Should you have any question, please do not hesitate to contact me via this email syazwanmarzuki.work@gmail.com
